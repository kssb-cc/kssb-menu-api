# KSSB Menu API

This is a Flask app that makes the KSSB Menu accessible via an API.

You can check out the [main repo](https://github.com/kssb-cc/kssb-menu) for more information about KSSB Menu itself.

## Usage
Here are basic commands to make this code run in your own environment:
```
git clone https://github.com/kssb-cc/kssb-menu-api.git
cd kssb-menu-api
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
```

## Note
You can specify a port if you want to run the Flask app on a different port by supplying it as an argument. For example, you can use:
```
python3 app.py 3045
```
And the server will run on port 3045.
